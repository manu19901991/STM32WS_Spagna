<br>
# **STM32CubeIDE** - basic project creation
<br>
## **Application description**
 - prepare template application which could be a staring point for workshop projects
 - send some data over USART1 (to be monitored by terminal application)
<br>

<br>
## **Task definition**
<br>
- Using STM32CubeIDE:
 - Configure system clock (SYSCLK and HCLK) to 4MHz using internal MSI oscillators (default settings)
 - Configure ICACHE (in any of available modes)
 - Select and configure USART1:
   - in asynchronous mode, 
   - using default settings (115200bps, 8D, 1stop bit, no parity) 
   - on PA9/PA10 pins
<br>

----

<br>
## **Step1** - project creation and peripherals configuration
 - Run **STM32CubeIDE**
 - Specify workspace location (i.e. `C:\_Work\U5_WS`)
<br>
![Workspace_start](./img/New_prj_start.gif)
<br>
- Start new project using one of the below methods:
  - by selecting `File->New->STM32Project` 
  - by click on `Start new STM32 project` button
  <br>
  ![Workspace_start2](./img/New_prj_start_2.gif)
<br>
- select STM32**U575ZI**TxQ MCU (the one present on NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q board)
- press `Next` button
- within STM32 Project window:
  - specify project name (i.e. `U5_Basic`)
  - keep **enable TrustZone** option unchecked
  - press `Finish` button
  - on warning pop-up window press `Yes` button
  <br>
   ![Workspace_start3](./img/New_prj_start_3.gif)
<br>
- within **Clock Configuration** tab:
  - keep the default settings (4MHz based on MSI)
<br>
  ![Clock configuration](./img/Clock_conf.gif)
<br>
- Peripherals configuration: Pinout&Configuration tab
<br>

- **USART1 configuration** (Connectivity group)
  - select Asynchronous mode
  - keep default settings in configuration:
    - Basic parameters: 115200bps, 8bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity
    - Pins assignment: PA9, PA10
    - no interrupts, no DMA usage
  <br>
    ![USART1 configuration](./img/USART1_conf.gif)
  <br>
- **ICACHE configuration** (System Core group)
  - select either 1-way or 2-ways (we will not focus on performance within this workshop)
  <br>
  ![ICACHE configuration](./img/ICACHE_conf.gif)
  <br>
<br>
- **Project settings**
  - select `Project Manager` tab
  - check project location (.ioc file)
  - check project name
<br>
   ![Project settings](./img/Prj_settings.gif)
<br>
  - generate project by one of the ways:
    - by pressing "gear" icon
    - by select `Project->Generate Code`
    - by pressing **Alt+K**
  - we will not use ICACHE in this example, thus press `Yes` on `Warning Code Generation` pop-up window
<br>
  ![Project generation](./img/Prj_gen.gif)
<br>
 - In case you see a warning pop-up window concerning SMPS configuration, please OK. This will be explained in next parts of the session.
----

<br>
## **Step2** - coding part (`main.c` file)
<br>
Define the buffer of bytes to be sent over **USART1** (`USER CODE PV` section):
<br>

```c
uint8_t buffer[]={"Homework exercise\n"};
```

<br>
![Coding1](./img/Code_copy1.gif)
<br>
Start transmit of the data over **USART1** using prepared buffer and ***polling*** method (`USER CODE 2` section):
<br>

```c
HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, buffer, 18, 200);
```

<br>
![Coding2](./img/Code_copy2.gif)
<br>

----

<br>
## **Step 3** - build the project, run the application
- Build the project using `hammer` button or `Project->Built All` or **Ctrl+B**
<br>
![Project build](./img/Build.gif)
<br>
- Connect board to PC using micro-USB cable
<br>
![Board connection](./img/Nucleo_connect.gif)
<br>
 - Start the debug session using `bug` icon or `Run->debug` or by pressing **F11**
 - All the settings should be automatically set based on your compiled project. Press `OK` button
 - At this moment you may see an information window that your STLink firmware is not up-to-date,
 - please accept this message and perform automatic upgrade process
<br>
![STLink_upgrade](./img/STLink_upgrade.gif)
<br>
 - Select `Switch` within `Configure Perspective Switch` dialog which is informing about new (debug one) windows setup within STM32CubeIDE application.
<br>
![Project debug](./img/Start_debug.gif)
<br>
 - Start terminal application and run it for virtual COM port number assigned to the NUCLEO board with settings: 115200bps, 8bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW control. As an alternative you can use STM32CubeIDE built-in terminal (please have a look within Appendix for more details)
 - run the application within debug session. As a result within terminal there should be "Homework exercise" message displayed.
  <br>
![Final app](./img/App_run_small.gif)
<br>
 - click on "terminate" icon to stop the debug session
<br>
![Terminate](./img/terminate.gif)
<br>

<ainfo>
 **Congratulations** You have completed homework part. Now you are fully prepared for the online workshop session 
</ainfo>

<br>
# **Appendix** - configuration and start **STM32CubeIDE** built-in terminal 
<br>
## You can follow dedicated video on this topic [here from 8:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWOV4j5fCS4&list=PLnMKNibPkDnFCosVVv98U5dCulE6T3Iy8&index=11&t=569s)
<br>
- Being in the debug session (debug perspective), please go to Console window (bottom part of the screen) 
- select `New -> 3 Command Shell Console` 
- specify `Connection Type` to **Serial Port**
- select **New** within `Connection name` (in case of previously configured connections you can select them from the list)
- in case of new connection, select its name (i.e. `Internal_Term`)
- select port number (used by STLink Virtual COM port - usually highest from the list)
- adapt communication parameters if needed (in our case default settings are inline with application ones)
- to confirm press `Finish`
- press `OK` on the next window
- After proper configuration, Console will contain terminal window (already connected)
- It is possible to disconnect the terminal, connect it or close it
